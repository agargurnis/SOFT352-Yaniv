                                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This unusual draw and discard game is played in Nepal, where it is known as
                                        Dhumbal or Jhyap. Under the name Yaniv it has also become popular in Israel in
                                        the last few years, mostly with younger players, both at home and when
                                        travelling abroad.
                                        <br />
                                        The objective of the game is to have a lower total value of cards in your hand
                                        than the other players. When you think you have achieved this, you call "Yaniv"
                                        to stop the play and compare hands. If someone else has an equal or lower
                                        total, the caller gets a penalty.
                                        <br />
                                        Each game is composed of rounds, and each player's total score is updated after
                                        each round. The goal of the game is to keep your score to a minimum. Players
                                        with more than 200 points, drop out of the game,
                                        which is then continued until there is only one player left.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Players and Cards</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This game can be played by 2 to 4 players. It is said to be best with 4
                                        players.
                                        <br />
                                        A 54 card deck is used - the standard international deck with two jokers.
                                        <br />
                                        Each card in the deck has a value: <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;-Jokers are worth zero.<br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;-Each ace is worth 1. <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;-Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.<br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;-Pictures (J, Q, K) are worth 10.</p>
                                    <h4>Deal</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Five cards are dealt to each player, one
                                        at a time, face down. The remaining cards are placed face down in the
                                        middle to
                                        form a drawing stock. The top card of the stock is turned face up and
                                        placed
                                        alongside it to start the "Dump Pile".
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Play</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The starting player for the first round is the player who created the
                                        game. In
                                        subsequent rounds
                                        the winner of the previous round starts. The turn to play passes
                                        clockwise
                                        around the table.

                                        In your turn you are allowed to do one of two things:
                                        <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Throw one or more cards from hand to the Dump Pile and
                                        then
                                        pick one
                                        card
                                        up.
                                        <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Call "Yaniv" to end the play, if you believe
                                        that the total value of your cards is less than that of any other
                                        player. You
                                        may call "Yaniv" only if the total value of your cards is less than
                                        6.
                                        <h5>Throwing and picking up</h5>
                                        A player can throw either:
                                        <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Any one card.
                                        <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) One set of two or more cards of the same rank (two 9s,
                                        three
                                        Kings,
                                        etc.).
                                        <br />
                                        No matter how many cards you throw, you pick up just one card. The
                                        cards that
                                        can be picked up are:
                                        <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The top card in the Draw pile.
                                        <br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) One of the cards thrown to the Dump Pile by the
                                        previous
                                        player.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Only one card or one combination set may be thrown in a turn. If
                                        after drawing a card you are holding for example 3-5-5-9-9 you can
                                        throw
                                        either the fives or the nines but not both.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        <h5>Ending the play</h5>
                                        If at the start of your turn you have 5 points or fewer in your hand,
                                        and you
                                        think you have the lowest total, you may call "Yaniv". This ends the
                                        play and
                                        everyone exposes their cards.
                                        <br />
                                        Note that you are not obliged to call when your total is 5 or less. You
                                        can
                                        throw and pick up if you wish, and play continues. Also, you cannot
                                        call other
                                        than at the beginning of your own turn. If after throwing and picking
                                        up you
                                        think you have the lowest total, you must wait for your next turn in
                                        order to
                                        end the play.
                                        <br />
                                        If the drawing deck is empty and no one has yet ended the play, all the
                                        cards
                                        of the dump pile except for the last player's discard are shuffled and
                                        stacked
                                        face down to make a new drawing deck.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Scoring</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The object is to score as few points as possible, and in particular to
                                        keep
                                        your cumulative total below 200.
                                        <br />
                                        When someone uses their turn to call for end the play, all players
                                        immediately
                                        reveal their cards.
                                        <br />
                                        If the caller succeeded (had the lowest number of points in their
                                        cards) - the
                                        caller scores 0 points, and the other players score however many points
                                        they
                                        have in their hands.
                                        If any other player has the same number of points or fewer points than
                                        the
                                        caller, the caller scores 30 penalty points plus whatever they had in
                                        their
                                        hand, and the other players score whatever they had in their hands as
                                        points
                                        (in this case even the player with the lowest hand scores points).
                                        <br />
                                        The player's total scores are kept from round to round.
                                        <br />
                                        The game ends when there is only one player with less than 200 points. In the
                                        unlikely situation of the last remaining players reaching over 200 at the same
                                        time, the player with the lowest score will win.
